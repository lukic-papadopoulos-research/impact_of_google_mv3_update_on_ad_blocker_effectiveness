NA & Ad-Blocking Effectiveness & Anti-Tracking Effectiveness & MV2 & MV3 & NA\\
Wills and Uzunoglu (2016) & No & Number of blocked unique domains in HTTP requests & Yes & No & Different ad blockers have varying levels of effectiveness. By default, uBlock has the best anti-tracking effectiveness, while Blur and Disconnect offer limited protection against trackers. Instead, Ghostery, Adblock Plus, and Adguard require manual configuration to provide significant anti-tracking effectiveness.\\
Garimella et al. (2017) & Total size of downloaded and uploaded data; cumulative time for loading the webpage; wall-clock time for loading the webpage & Number of blocked HTTP requests; number of blocked unique domains in HTTP requests & Yes & No & uBlock has improved ad-blocking and anti-tracking effectiveness while preserving user privacy compared to other analyzed ad blockers. However, using ad blockers may not always make websites load faster because ad blockers can add extra trackers to the website, harming users' privacy.\\
Merzdovnik et al. (2017) & No & Number of blocked HTTP requests; number of blocked unique domains in HTTP requests & Yes & No & Some ad blockers like uBlock, Disconnect, Ghostery, and PrivacyBadger have good anti-tracking effectiveness against many commonly used trackers. However, they often struggle to block fingerprinting scripts and less commonly used trackers.\\
Borgolte and Feamster (2020) & No & Number of blocked 
(HTTP) resources and cookies & Yes & No & Ad blockers can improve user privacy and browsing experience by reducing website load time, data transfers, and processor usage, providing additional benefits from anti-tracking effectiveness.\\

This study & Number of blocked ads & Number of blocked trackers & Yes & Yes & All four ad blockers (Adblock Plus, AdGuard, Stands, uBlock) have equal ad-blocking effectiveness in their MV3 instances compared to their MV2 counterparts. Adblock Plus and Stands block more trackers under MV3 than under MV2, while AdGuard and uBlock do not; using multiple MV3 ad blockers improves anti-tracking relative to several single MV3 blockers.\\
