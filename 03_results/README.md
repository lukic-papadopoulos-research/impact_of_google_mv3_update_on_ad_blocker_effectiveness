## Regenerating Results

To regenerate all figures and tables:

```r
# From repository root
renv::restore()  # If not already done
source("02_scripts/02_R/reproducible_analysis.R")
```

All files in this directory will be overwritten with freshly generated outputs.

## Including in LaTeX Documents

Example usage in LaTeX:

```latex
% For figures
\begin{figure}[htbp]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{03_results/03_figure.pdf}
  \caption{Distribution of blocked ads and trackers.}
  \label{fig:distribution}
\end{figure}

% For tables
\input{03_results/01_table.tex}
```

## File Sizes

Figures are generated at 300 DPI for publication quality. File sizes range from ~5KB (simple bar charts) to ~660KB (detailed illustrations).
