Robustness Test & Fundamental Concern & Summary of Result & Appendix\\
\midrule
Effectiveness of MV3 Ad Blockers Across Different Samples & Our main sample might not be representative of the overall population of websites; need for additional, more representative samples & Findings are consistent across two stratified samples (stratified by website employee count and Tranco popularity rank), confirming the robustness of our main results. & B.1\\
Alternative Measures for Ad Blocker Effectiveness & The original measures of ad blocker effectiveness might fail to capture certain types of ads or lesser-known trackers; need for alternative measures. & Results remain consistent using HTML file size (kb) of loaded websites and number of blocked third-party domains, confirming the robustness of our main results. & B.2\\
Effectiveness of Early MV3 Ad Blockers & Instances of early MV3 ad blockers might have been less effective; need to assess if their effectiveness changed over time. & Early MV3 instances are as effective as later ones; effectiveness has remained consistent over time. & B.3\\
Effectiveness of MV3 Ad Blockers on Firefox & Findings might be specific to Chrome; need to verify results across different browsers. & Results on Firefox align with those on Chrome; uBlock’s effectiveness remains consistent across browsers. & B.4\\
Visual Inspection of MV3 and MV2 Ad Blocker Screenshots & Potential ad flickering, unintended blockage of legitimate content or cosmetic differences might not be fully captured by our metrics. & We detected no noticeable ad flickering or website breakage in screenshots; we observed some differences in the visibility of cosmetic placeholders. & B.5\\
